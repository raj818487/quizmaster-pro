# Frontend Cleanup Documentation

This document outlines the cleanup operations performed on the QuizMaster Pro frontend project to remove unnecessary backend-related files and dependencies.

## Completed Cleanup Tasks

### Files Removed

- `src/app/core/sqlite.service.ts` - Deprecated service that was only providing stubs and warnings

### Files Already Moved to Backend

- All server implementation files
- Database schema and migration scripts
- API implementation

### Configuration Updates

- Updated `proxy.conf.json` to point to the new backend server on port 4000
- Ensured proper Angular development server configuration

## Project Structure After Cleanup

The project now has a clean separation between frontend and backend:

1. **Frontend (root directory)**

   - Angular application with components, services, and UI
   - Environment configuration pointing to backend API
   - PWA support with manifest and service worker

2. **Backend (backend/ directory)**
   - Express.js server implementation
   - API endpoints for all features
   - Database implementation with SQLite
   - Swagger API documentation

## Running the Application

To run both frontend and backend together:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

This starts:

- Backend API server on http://localhost:4000
- Angular frontend on http://localhost:4200 (proxies API requests to the backend)
- Swagger API documentation on http://localhost:4000/api-docs
